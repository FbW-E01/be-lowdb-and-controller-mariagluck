# Users, Posts, Oh my!

- I want *you* to continue building our API
- Our API already knows how to deal with Posts pretty well
- Make it so that it knows how to deal with Users properly
- Users should be saved (similar to posts) using `LowDB`

1. Fix the endpoint that lists users
2. Add an endpoint to delete users
3. Add an endpoint to create users
4. Add an endpoint to update users
5. Make sure to use express.Router and Controller files

- *BONUS* Make sure you use "Fat Models" - the logic for creating, updating and deleting both Users and Posts is stored in the "Model" part of your application.
